A few Reimplementations of Dial a ride problem solution papers and problem variations.

[x] Analyze the initial construction solution.
[x] Analyze effects of changing vehicle order.

To Do 
[] Checking route feasibleness (1)
[] Checking Insertion into Route feasibleness (2)
[] Parallel heuristics insertion (3)

3 requires 2 and 2 requires 1.
[] Sequential Xover 
[] Assigning Xover

[] Repairing Infeasibility
[] Local Search 
[] * 2-Opt 
[] ** Inter
[] ** Intra routes
[] * Remove 2 (From one route) insert 1 by 1 (Into Other Routes)

[] Mutation
	[] Inter-route
		[] 2-opt H cap
		[] Random Remove from largest Route, Random Valid P Insert to smallest Route
	[] Intra-route
		[] (Choose two points change)
